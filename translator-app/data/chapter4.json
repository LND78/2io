          "answer": "The abundance of labor in the market affected the lives of workers badly. Due to the large number of people seeking jobs, wages remained low. Workers had to wait for weeks to get work. They had to spend nights under bridges or in night shelters run by the law department."

          "answer": "**Proto-Industrialization:** Even before factories began to dot the landscape in England and Europe, there was large-scale industrial production for an international market. This was not based on factories. Historians refer to this phase of industrialization as proto-industrialization.\n\n**Control by East India Company:**\n1. The Company appointed a paid servant called the Gomastha to supervise weavers, collect supplies, and examine the quality of cloth.\n2. It prevented Company weavers from dealing with other buyers. One way of doing this was through the system of advances.\n3. Once an order was placed, the weavers were given loans to purchase the raw material for their production. Those who took loans had to hand over the cloth they produced to the Gomastha. They could not take it to any other trader."

          "originalText": "ब्रिटिश औद्योगीकरण के कारण भारतीय बुनकरों को किन समस्याओं का सामना करना पड़ा?",
          "answer": "In the 19th century, Indian weavers faced the following problems:\n1. Their export market collapsed, and the local market shrank, being glutted with Manchester imports.\n2. Produced by machines at lower costs, the imported cotton goods were so cheap that weavers could not easily compete with them.\n3. By the 1860s, weavers faced a new problem. They could not get sufficient supply of raw cotton of good quality. When the American Civil War broke out and cotton supplies from the US were cut off, Britain turned to India. As raw cotton exports from India increased, the price of raw cotton shot up.\n4. By the end of the 19th century, weavers and other craftspeople faced yet another problem. Factories in India began production, flooding the market with machine-goods."
